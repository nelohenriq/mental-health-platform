# Mental Health Support Platform - Architecture Decisions

## Project Context & Constraints

**Project Type**: Full-stack web/mobile hybrid for consumer SaaS
**Target Audience**: Individual users seeking mental health support
**Team Size**: 2-5 developers with strong JavaScript/TypeScript experience
**Timeline**: 3-month MVP with focus on core features
**Budget**: Free/low-cost options, basic DevOps skills
**Scale**: <1K users initially, <500ms response times, <10GB data

## Core Architectural Decisions

### 1. Monorepo with Next.js 15 (OVERRIDES proposal suggestion of separate frontend/backend)

**Decision**: Use Next.js 15 App Router as a monorepo solution combining frontend and backend
**Rationale**:
- **Team Experience**: Strong JavaScript/TypeScript skills align perfectly with Next.js
- **Simplified Architecture**: Single codebase reduces complexity for small team
- **Full-Stack Capabilities**: Built-in API routes eliminate need for separate backend service
- **Cost Effective**: Vercel hosting is free for small projects
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, TypeScript support, and modern tooling out-of-the-box
- **Mobile Ready**: Easy extension to React Native + Expo

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate React frontend + Express backend (too complex for small team)
- Traditional MERN stack (additional infrastructure overhead)
- SvelteKit (team not familiar, learning curve)

### 2. SQLite for Development, MongoDB for Production (OVERRIDES design suggestion of PostgreSQL only)

**Decision**: SQLite with Prisma for development, MongoDB for production
**Rationale**:
- **Zero-Config Development**: SQLite requires no setup, perfect for rapid prototyping
- **Team Productivity**: Instant database setup vs. complex database configuration
- **Cost Effective**: Free SQLite for development, MongoDB Atlas free tier available
- **Migration Path**: Prisma handles schema changes seamlessly between environments
- **Document Flexibility**: MongoDB's document model suits mental health data with varying structures (mood entries, conversation logs, CBT exercises)
- **Performance**: Sufficient for <1K users with proper indexing

**Trade-offs**: File-based database not suitable for high concurrency, but acceptable for MVP scale

### 3. Multi-Provider AI Integration with User API Keys (ENHANCES design requirements)

**Decision**: Support OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, and xAI Grok with user-configurable API keys
**Rationale**:
- **Flexibility**: Users can choose providers based on cost, quality, or availability
- **Cost Control**: Users pay for their own AI usage, reducing platform costs
- **Reliability**: Multiple providers ensure service continuity if one fails
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new providers as they emerge
- **Privacy**: No need to store user conversations on platform servers

**Implementation**: Vercel AI SDK provides unified interface for all providers

### 4. Modern UI Stack: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS (OVERRIDES custom component library suggestion)

**Decision**: shadcn/ui built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS
**Rationale**:
- **Developer Experience**: Pre-built, accessible components save development time
- **Consistency**: Design system ensures cohesive UI across web and mobile
- **Accessibility**: Radix UI primitives are WCAG compliant out-of-the-box
- **Performance**: Tailwind's utility-first approach minimizes CSS bundle size
- **Customization**: Easy to customize components while maintaining consistency
- **Modern Standards**: Follows current design system best practices

**Benefits**: Faster development, better accessibility, smaller bundle size than custom libraries

### 5. Zustand + TanStack Query for State Management (SIMPLIFIES design suggestion of Redux)

**Decision**: Zustand for global state, TanStack Query for server state
**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: Less boilerplate than Redux Toolkit for small team
- **Performance**: Zustand is lightweight and tree-shakable
- **Server State**: TanStack Query handles API state, caching, and synchronization
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with excellent DX
- **Learning Curve**: Easier for team than complex Redux patterns

**Result**: Cleaner codebase with better performance and developer experience

### 6. tRPC for Type-Safe APIs (ENHANCES design REST + GraphQL suggestion)

**Decision**: tRPC for end-to-end type safety between frontend and backend
**Rationale**:
- **Type Safety**: Eliminates API communication errors through TypeScript
- **Developer Experience**: Auto-completion and type checking across client-server boundary
- **Performance**: No runtime overhead, compiled to efficient HTTP calls
- **Simplicity**: No need for separate API documentation or schemas
- **Monorepo Friendly**: Perfect fit for Next.js full-stack architecture

**Benefits**: Faster development, fewer bugs, better maintainability

### 7. Vercel for Hosting and Deployment (OPPOSED to complex Kubernetes suggestion)

**Decision**: Vercel for frontend/backend, Railway/PlanetScale for database
**Rationale**:
- **Zero DevOps**: Automatic deployments, scaling, and CDN
- **Cost Effective**: Generous free tier, pay-as-you-grow pricing
- **Developer Experience**: Git integration, preview deployments, analytics
- **Performance**: Global CDN, automatic optimizations
- **Ecosystem**: Perfect integration with Next.js and Prisma

**For Small Team**: Eliminates infrastructure management overhead

### 8. GDPR-Compliant Data Handling (MEETS compliance requirements)

**Decision**: Built-in data export/deletion, consent management, data minimization
**Rationale**:
- **Legal Requirements**: GDPR compliance essential for EU users and mental health data
- **Trust Building**: Privacy-focused features increase user confidence
- **Implementation**: Prisma makes data operations straightforward
- **Future-Proof**: Foundation for HIPAA compliance if expanding to healthcare

**Features**: User data export, account deletion, granular privacy controls

## Technology Choices Rationale

### Why Next.js over alternatives?
- **Full-Stack**: Eliminates need for separate API server
- **Modern**: App Router, Server Components, streaming
- **Ecosystem**: Massive community, excellent documentation
- **Performance**: Automatic optimizations, edge runtime

### Why Prisma over alternatives?
- **Type Safety**: Generated client prevents runtime errors
- **Migrations**: Safe schema evolution
- **Multi-Database**: Same API for SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent DX with Studio and auto-completion

### Why pnpm over npm/yarn?
- **Performance**: Faster installs, better disk usage
- **Monorepo Support**: Native workspace support
- **Strict**: Prevents phantom dependencies

### Why Vitest over Jest?
- **Performance**: 10-100x faster than Jest
- **ESM Support**: Native ES modules
- **TypeScript**: Built-in TypeScript support
- **Next.js Integration**: Recommended by Next.js team

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AI Provider Dependency**: Multi-provider support ensures fallback options
- **Database Scaling**: PostgreSQL migration path clearly defined
- **Mobile Complexity**: Expo provides unified development experience

### Business Risks
- **Cost Overruns**: Free/low-cost stack keeps expenses minimal
- **Timeline Delays**: MVP-focused approach with clear scope boundaries
- **User Adoption**: Privacy-first design builds trust

### Team Risks
- **Learning Curve**: Familiar technologies minimize ramp-up time
- **Maintenance Burden**: Modern, well-supported tools reduce technical debt
- **Scalability Concerns**: Architecture designed for growth
