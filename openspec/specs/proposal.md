# Mental Health Support Platform Proposal

## Project Overview
Build a comprehensive, compassionate mental health support platform that integrates multiple evidence-based approaches to mental wellness. The platform will serve as a digital companion combining the calming features of meditation apps like Calm, the therapeutic techniques of CBT-focused apps like Woebot, and the conversational AI capabilities of advanced chatbots like ChatGPT, specifically tailored for mental health support.

## Core Features
- **Mood Tracking**: Daily mood logging with visual charts and trend analysis
- **CBT Techniques**: Interactive cognitive behavioral therapy exercises and worksheets

- **Crisis Detection**: Automated monitoring for crisis indicators with appropriate interventions
- **Personalized Coping Strategies**: Adaptive recommendations based on user patterns and preferences

## Target Users
- Individuals seeking daily mental health support
- People with anxiety, depression, or stress-related conditions
- Users looking for preventive mental wellness tools
- Those who prefer digital therapy alongside traditional care

## Value Proposition
