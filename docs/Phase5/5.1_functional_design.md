3. **Start**: Begin exercise with progress tracking
4. **Navigate**: Step-through with save/resume capability
5. **Complete**: Achievement celebration and insights
6. **Reflect**: Optional reflection prompts
7. **Next Steps**: Personalized recommendations

**Edge Cases:**
- Time constraints: Save and resume functionality
- Cognitive load: Simplified mode for high-stress users
